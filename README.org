* Configuration
You need get yourself an API key to be able to use this package, see [[https://omdbapi.com/][OMDb website]]. After getting yourself an API key, you can start using.

#+begin_src elisp
  (setq orgmdb-omdb-apikey "YOUR-API-KEY")
#+end_src

* Interactive usage
~orgmdb.el~ offers several actions that you can call upon a movie/show/episode objects. These actions can be accessed by calling ~orgmdb-act~ function. A movie/show object is simply an org header with a tag, like the following:

#+begin_src org
  ,* Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) :movie:
  ,* Succession (2018-) :series:
#+end_src

You can put your cursor on one of the headers and call ~orgmdb-act~. From the menu, you can select ~Fill movie properties~ to pull movie metadata under the ~:PROPERTIES:~ drawer of the selected header. From now on, you can use other actions defined under the ~orgmdb-act~ menu.

An episode object is a special one, because it can be either a header containing an episode marker object (meaning something like ~S02E05~) with an ~:episode:~ tag:

#+begin_src org
  ,* Succession (2018-) :series:
  ,** S01E08 - Prague :episode:
#+end_src

or it can be simply an episode marker object:

#+begin_src org
  ,* Succession (2018-) :series:
  - ...
  - I watched S01E08 yesterday and it was cool.
  -           ^^^^^^ here is our episode marker object
#+end_src

In both cases, if your cursor is on the episode object, ~orgmdb-act~ will understand the context and show the actions accordingly.


Here are the actions and their simple explanations:
- ~Fill properties~ :: Fill the metadata of the current object.
- ~Show detailed info~ :: Open a nicely formatted org buffer and display a detailed info of the current object with a small poster of it.
- ~Select an episode...~ :: Select an episode of the currently focused show and act on it.
- ~Open local video~ :: Find the local video file containing the current movie/show/episode. It searches video files under ~orgmdb-video-dir~ and looks for files with ~orgmdb-video-file-extensions~ extensions. ~orgmdb-player-function~ is used for opening the video file.

** Defining new actions
You can define new actions for movie/show/episode objects using ~orgmdb-defaction~ function. See the following example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (orgmdb-defaction
   :name 'show-title
   ;; ^ Define a unique name for this action
   :definition "Show title of the currently selected object"
   ;; ^ User-facing definition of the action
   :on '(movie show episode)
   ;; ^ On what objects this action should appear?
   :act (cl-function
         (lambda (type &key title imdb-id episode &allow-other-keys)
           (message "The title is "))))
#+end_src

* Library usage
#+begin_src elisp
  (let ((movie (orgmdb :title "in the mood for love")))
    (format "Movie name: %s, Year: %s, Plot: %s"
            (orgmdb-title movie)
            (orgmdb-year movie)
            (orgmdb-plot movie)))
